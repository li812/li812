ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a passionate **Data Science Enthusiast** and **MCA student** at Sree Narayana Institute of Technology, Kollam, Kerala. With a strong foundation in **Django web development** and a knack for **machine learning**, I specialize in creating impactful applications that solve real-world problems.

ðŸ’» My projects span diverse domains, including:
- **Healthcare**: Predictive tools like heart failure diagnostics and stroke risk comparison.
- **Space Science**: ML-based asteroid impact prediction and galaxy classification.
- **Wildlife & Conservation**: Real-time animal monitoring and marine species detection using YOLO.

ðŸŒŸ I love mentoring others and have conducted **free Django workshops**, guiding students to deploy their own projects.

ðŸ”¬ I'm also diving into advanced AI projects like **brain tumor classification** using CNNs and TensorFlow, focusing on explainability and visualization.

ðŸ“Š My expertise extends to **Business Intelligence Solutions**, and I actively support academic project development through training.

ðŸŽ¯ Fun fact: I enjoy exploring history and myths.
